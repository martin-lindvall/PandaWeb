        <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dà xióng māo), also known as Mr Panda Bear or simply panda,
            is a bear native to south central China.</p>

        <p>It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.
            The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda.</p>

        <p>Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.
            In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>

        <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.
            As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.</p>

        <p>The giant panda is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in
            captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country. As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas
            lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different countries. Wild population estimates
            vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild, while a 2006 study via
            DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000. Some reports also show that
            the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise. In March 2015, conservation news site Mongabay
            stated that the wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864. In 2016, the IUCN
            reclassified the species from "endangered" to "vulnerable".</p>
