    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dà xióng māo), also known as Mr Panda Bear or simply panda,
        is a bear native to south central China.</p>

    <p>It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.
        The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda.</p>

    <p>Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.
        In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>

    <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.
        As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.</p>
